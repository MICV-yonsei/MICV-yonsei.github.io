The dual branch framework consists of the Class-Aware Knowledge branch with CNN and the Semantic-Aware Knowledge branch with ViT. They give complementary knowledge to each branch. Motivation While Class Activation Maps (CAMs) using CNNs have steadily been contributing to the success of WSSS, the resulting activation maps often narrowly focus on class-specific parts (e.g., only face of human). On the other hand, recent works based on vision transformers (ViT) have shown promising results based on their self-attention mechanism to capture the semantic parts but fail in capturing complete class-specific details (e.g., entire body parts of human but also with a dog nearby). The figure shows the comparison of object localization maps from each CNN, ViT, and Cobra branches for various subjects (human, dog, airplane), illustrating the distinctive areas of interest each model identifies. Our model successfully utilizes complementary characteristics to localize the exact object of the correct class and its semantic parts. Key Contribution We propose a dual branch framework, namely Complementary Branch (CoBra), which aims to fuse the complementary nature of CNN and ViT localization maps. We capture the class and semantic knowledge as Class Aware Projection (CAP) and Semantic-Aware Projection (SAP) respectively for effective complementary guidance to the CNN and ViT branches in CoBra, employing contrastive learning for enhanced guidance. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively investigate how CNN and ViT complement each other on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and MS COCO 2014 dataset, showing a state-of-the-art WSSS result. Main model Overview illustration of our model. (I) Class Aware Knoweldge(CAK): The CNN outputs a feature map which generates (1) CNN CAMs via $f_{CAM}$, (2) Pseudo-Labels from CNN CAMs via $argmax$, and (3) Class-Aware Projection (CAP) via $f_{proj}$. (II) Semantic Aware Knowledge(SAK): The ViT outputs $N^2$ Patch Embeddings which generate (1) ViT CAMs via $f_{CAM}$ and (2) Semantic-Aware Projection (SAP) via $f_{proj}$. We also use the Attention Maps of all $L$-layers to generate (3) Patch Affinity of size $N^2 \\times N^2$. Method Illustration of refining CAP and SAP from SAK and CAK branch respectively. (I) Class Aware Knoweldge(CAK): The CAP values are embedded in the Class Feature Space. (1) The patch affinity from SAK branch assigns the positive (green), negative (red), and neutral (teal) patches based on the target (white) patch. (2) The CNN CAM shows that the false negative patches have been weakly localized as horse. (3) The CAP loss pull those weakly localized patches (i.e., false class negatives) since they are assigned as semantically positive patches based on SAK branch. (3) The CAP is refined to improve the CNN CAM showing fewer false class negatives. (II) Semantic Aware Knowledge(SAK): The SAP values are embedded in the Semantic Feature Space. (1) The CNN CAM from CAK branch assigns the positive (green), negative (red), and neutral (teal) patches based on the target (white) patch. (2) The ViT CAM shows that the negative patches have been incorrectly localized as horse. The SAP loss pushes away those incorrectly localized patches (i.e., false class positives) since they are assigned as negative patches based on CAK branch. (3) The SAP is refined to improve the ViT CAM showing fewer false class positives.

Abstract Recent advances in text-conditioned image generation diffusion models have begun paving the way for new opportunities in modern medical domain, in particular, generating Chest X-rays (CXRs) from diagnostic reports. Nonetheless, to further drive the diffusion models to generate CXRs that faithfully reflect the complexity and diversity of real data, it has become evident that a nontrivial learning approach is needed. In light of this, we propose CXRL, a framework motivated by the potential of reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we integrate a policy gradient RL approach with well-designed multiple distinctive CXR-domain specific reward models. This approach guides the diffusion denoising trajectory, achieving precise CXR posture and pathological details. Here, considering the complex medical image environment, we present “RL with Comparative Feedback” (RLCF) for the reward mechanism, a human-like comparative evaluation that is known to be more effective and reliable in complex scenarios compared to direct evaluation. Our CXRL framework includes jointly optimizing learnable adaptive condition embeddings (ACE) and the image generator, enabling the model to produce more accurate and higher perceptual CXR quality. Our extensive evaluation of the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our RL-based tuning approach. Consequently, our CXRL generates pathologically realistic CXRs, establishing a new standard for generating CXRs with high fidelity to real-world clinical scenarios. Video Method Pipeline The pipeline of CXRL. Our model employs policy gradient optimization utilizing multi-reward feedback, fine-tuning image generator, and ACE to produce realistic and accurate CXR that corresponds closely to the input report. Contribution Our study pioneers in applying RL to text-conditioned medical image synthesis, particularly in CXRs, focusing on detail refinement and input condition control for clinical accuracy. We advance report-to-CXR generation with an RLCF-based rewarding mechanism, emphasizing posture alignment, pathology accuracy, and consistency between input reports and generated CXRs. We jointly optimize the image generator and ACE via reward feedback models, ensuring image-text alignment and medical accuracy across varied reports, setting a new benchmark in a report-to-CXR generation. Reward Feedback Models A detailed illustration of our reward feedback models. We incorporate three different feedbacks for report-to-CXR generation model to generate goal-oriented CXRs. Posture Alignment Feedback: Generated CXRs often face scaling issues, like excessive zooming or rotation, obscuring essential details. To counter these undesirable effects, we introduce a reward signal to align the CXR\u0026#39;s posture with a canonical orientation to preserve essential parts. Diagnostic Condition Feedback: To accurately reflect generated CXRs with referenced pathologies, we classify them using a parsed report label, rewarding its accuracy. Multimodal Consistency Feedback: We enforce the generated CXRs to better match their reports. We leverage a multimodal latent representation pretrained with CXR-report pairs for semantic agreement assessment.

Abstract Semantic segmentation has innately relied on extensive pixel-level labeled annotated data, leading to the emergence of unsupervised methodologies. Among them, leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformers for unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) has been making steady progress with expressive deep features. Yet, for semantically segmenting images with complex objects, a predominant challenge remains: the lack of explicit object-level semantic encoding in patch-level features. This technical limitation often leads to inadequate segmentation of complex objects with diverse structures. To address this gap, we present a novel approach, EAGLE, which emphasizes object-centric representation learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce EiCue, a spectral technique providing semantic and structural cues through an eigenbasis derived from the semantic similarity matrix of deep image features and color affinity from an image. Further, by incorporating our object-centric contrastive loss with EiCue, we guide our model to learn object-level representations with intra- and inter-image object-feature consistency, thereby enhancing semantic accuracy. Extensive experiments on COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and Potsdam-3 datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art USS results of EAGLE with accurate and consistent semantic segmentation across complex scenes. Video Method Pipeline The pipeline of EAGLE. Leveraging the Laplacian matrix, which integrates hierarchically projected image key features and color affinity, the model exploits eigenvector clustering to capture object-level perspective cues defined as \\( \\mathrm{\\mathcal{M}}_{eicue} \\) and \\( \\mathrm{\\tilde{\\mathcal{M}}_{eicue}} \\). Distilling knowledge from \\( \\mathrm{\\mathcal{M}}_{eicue} \\), our model further adopts an object-centric contrastive loss, utilizing the projected vector \\( \\mathrm{Z} \\) and \\( \\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}} \\). The learnable prototype \\( \\mathrm{\\Phi} \\) assigned from \\( \\mathrm{Z} \\) and \\( \\mathrm{\\tilde{Z}} \\), acts as a singular anchor that contrasts positive objects and negative objects. Our object-centric contrastive loss is computed in two distinct manners: intra(\\( \\mathrm{\\mathcal{L}}_{obj} \\))- and inter(\\( \\mathrm{\\mathcal{L}}_{sc} \\))-image to ensure semantic consistency. Eigen Aggregation Module An illustration of the EiCue generation. From the input image, both color affinity matrix \\( \\mathrm{A_{color}} \\) and semantic similarity matrix \\( \\mathrm{A_{seg}} \\) are derived, which are combined to form the Laplacian \\( \\mathrm{L_{sym}} \\). An eigenvector subset \\( \\mathrm{\\hat{V}} \\) of \\( \\mathrm{L_{sym}} \\) are clustered to produce EiCue. Visualization of Primary Elements Eigenvectors Visualizing eigenvectors derived from \\( \\mathrm{S} \\) in the Eigen Aggregation Module. These eigenvectors not only distinguish different objects but also identify semantically related areas, highlighting how EiCue captures object semantics and boundaries effectively.

The bottom row presents EiCue, highlighting its superior ability to capture subtle structural intricacies and understand deeper semantic relationships, which is not as effectively achieved by K-means.
